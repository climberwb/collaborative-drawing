 This was originally an application that allowed for collaborative drawing. Multiple Users can pitch in and draw a picture. 
 I since updated the functionality to make it a pictionary game. The first person who connects to the application is the drawers
 and the following connections are the guessers. Once a guesser guesses the correct answer he or she then becomes the drawer. 
 This uses websockets and express to allow to present guesses and drawings in real time to users participating in the game.
