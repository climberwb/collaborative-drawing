 This was originally an application that allowed for collaborative drawing. Multiple users can pitch in and draw a picture simultaneously. 
 I since updated the functionality to make it a pictionary game. The first person who connects to the application is the drawer
 and the following connections are the guessers. Once a guesser guesses the correct answer he or she then becomes the drawer. 
 This application uses websockets and is built ontop of express to present guesses and drawings in real time to users participating in the game.
